I was wondering how I could change some of the aspects of tetris -- height, width, game-pieces, and how it would affect game-play. I know this has been done, and there are probably even mathematical studies on the various piece-permutations. But I wanted to experience it, right?

Only the code is filled with magic-string, magic-numbers, assumptions of size, length, and data-models. You can add a new piece, but it won't be selected. Or colored. Or scored, or... any number of things that have to be modified all over the place.

So, I think I'm going to fiddle....
